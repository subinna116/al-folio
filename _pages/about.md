## About Me

I am a researcher and scholar focused on advancing **recovery-oriented and equitable mental health systems**. My work integrates implementation science, quantitative methods, and recovery theory to understand and improve mental health servicesâ€”particularly for individuals with serious mental illness and racially or linguistically minoritized populations.

## Research Focus

My research bridges the gap between knowing what good mental health practice looks like and making it happen in real systems. I examine:

**Recovery-Oriented Practice & Competencies**
- How practitioner competencies, organizational climates, and implementation strategies shape access and recovery outcomes
- The role of cultural humility and stigma reduction in mental health services

**Implementation & Systems Science**
- Structural and organizational factors that facilitate or hinder service delivery
- How policy, workforce composition, and resource allocation impact equitable access

**Service Engagement & Health Disparities**
- Help-seeking behaviors among marginalized communities
- Predictive modeling to identify who disengages from care and why
- Technology-assisted peer support and digital mental health interventions

## Methodological Approach

I employ quantitative and computational methods including:
- Large-scale administrative and survey data analysis
- Machine learning and predictive modeling
- Implementation science frameworks (e.g., CFIR)
